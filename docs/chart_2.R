#CHART 2: number of hospitalizations for each state Leaflet Map (if weâ€™re allowed to use)
#This data provides the reader with the hospitalizations related to COVID 19 BY EACH MONTH
#This is important because it provides justification for why some states may have received more money then others, hence a state with high allocation funds could have been because they had more patients and hence had more need
